Stored Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS):
Stored XSS, occurs when user supplied input is stored and then rendered within a web page. Typical entry points for stored XSS are: message forums, blog comments, user profiles and username fields. An attacker typically exploits this vulnerability by injecting XSS payloads, tricking them into viewing the page that contains the stored XSS payload. The victim visits the page and the payload is executed client side by the victim’s web browser. Stored XSS is also known as persistent XSS.
Attack Vector: 
Stored XSS is particularly dangerous in application areas where users with high privileges have access. When the administrator visits the vulnerable page, the attack is automatically executed by their browser. This might expose sensitive information such as session authorization tokens and it can  be used in combination with other web vulnerabilities to exploit a higher severity security vulnerability.
Vulnerable Parameters: First Name, Last Name
