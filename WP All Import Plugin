WordPress Plugin WP All Import 3.7.3 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious code, typically in the form of script tags or other HTML elements into web applications. 
This injected code is then stored persistently on the server and is later served to other users when they access the affected content. 
Here stored cross-site scripting (XSS) was identified in the description field of the new import associated with the "img" tag during the creation of WordPress posts.

How to reproduce vulnerability:
1. Install WordPress 6.4.1 and add WP All Import 3.7.3 plugin
2. Create a New Import for WordPress Posts. Navigate to All Import > New Import > Select Import file > Give title and Desciption.
3. For Description field, select "img" as html tag, and add stored XSS payload in the description of the image and complete the process.
4. Confirm & Run import
5. Navigate to Posts section from the left side of the dashboard menu > All Posts > click on the post which we have created
6. Visit the URL of the post from the right menu of the page and observe that XSS is triggered when the post's URL is loaded.
